Object of the Game:
    The object of the game is to have the player guess a randomly generated code of colors within a specified amount of guesses
        - Considering starting off with 8 maximum attempts
          - If I can get that working, see if I can make it dynamic by either:
            - Adding difficulty options that increase to 12 if very easy, 10 if easy, 6 if hard, 4 if very hard
            - Allowing the player to choose the amount of guesses they would like up to a maximum of 12

    Player must make a choice of any combination of four colors from the following options:
        -Red
        -Blue
        -Yellow
        -Green
        -
